## These Rules

These rules are used to apply a pre-authentication configuration to a Virtual Service (version 4.2.0 onwards). The authentication server and rule specified in any one of these rules should be created before it is applied. For more information see the [Authentication section](https://www.jetnexus.com/usercentral/4-2-0/authentication.html) of the [User Guide](https://www.jetnexus.com/usercentral/4-2-0/). 

### Installation

Clone this repository, then, in the jetNEXUS GUI, browse to `Advanced > Configuration > Browse`, select the folder you cloned to and the rule you want and click on **Upload Config or jetPACK**. 

If you'd rather not use Git then click on the rule you want to install (above), then click **Raw** and then **Save [Page] As...** and download the text file to a suitable location. 

Then, in the jetNEXUS GUI, browse to `Advanced > Configuration > Browse`, choose the rule you downloaded and click on **Upload Config or jetPACK**.

Rules can be modified to suit your needs under: `Library > flightPATH`.

To assign rules to Virtual Services go to: `Services > IP Services > Virtual Services > flightPATH`.

### Caution

Most of these rules can be applied with little, if any, risk but in all cases you are advised to test thoroughly before deploying on any live site or service.
